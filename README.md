## ⚠️ Note about the ESP32-C6 board

Using the Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C6 is a breethe. 

The documentation is excellent.
The chip already contains a BMS so you can plug the battery directly in and charge it with USB-C

---

## 🧰 Build Instructions

### 🪛 1. Print and Prepare the Case
- Print all parts. Only the remix part is present in github, everything else can be found on printables.
- Verify that magnets, switches, and PCB fit snugly before final assembly.
- Insert **M2.5 heat-set inserts** into the designated mounting points using a soldering iron at ~200 °C.

### ⚡ 2. Mount the Components
- **Cherry MX switches**: press-fit into the 16-slot plate, solder to perfboard or PCB or with simple wires.
- **XIAO ESP32C6**: simply clip in place with any fixation. You might need to push a bit hard.
- **6 mm BOOT button**: mount to a small hole on the side (for Zigbee reset). Add some glue from glue gun.
- **Power switch**: connect inline with battery’s.
- **Battery holder**: Press fit battery inside. The EBL battery have a builtin BMS so I glue them in their slot with the micro usb accessible outside.
- **Magnets**: press-fit into the lid and base for a secure snap fit. You can add super glue to make sure they don't move.

### 🔋 3. Wiring Overview
| Connection | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **GPIO 0(D0),1(D1),2(D2),4(MTMS) and 18(D10),19(D9),20(D8),17(D7)** | 0,1,2,4 are for Rows, 18,19,20,17 are for Columns. Follow the wiring diagram. Connect 4 wires to columns and to one side of every switch. Connect all diodes to the other side of the switch. Make sure the black marker is connected to the switch and the other end is connected to the 3 other diodes on the same row. |
| **GPIO 9(BOOT)** | BOOT / Reset button. Connect to one side of the 6mm button and the other to GND. |
| **Battery pack** | Bat+ and Bat- on the ESP32 with bat + in line with the On/Off switch. |
| **On/Off switch** | Inline with battery lead. |

### 🔧 4. Flash the Firmware
1. Install **ESP-IDF v5.3.4** (or newer).  
2. Clone or copy the project to your workspace.  
3. Build and flash:
   ```bash
   idf.py set-target esp32c6
   idf.py build
   idf.py flash monitor
   ```
The device will enter Zigbee pairing mode when factory-new.

## 🔗 Pair with Home Assistant

Add macropad.mjs file to config/zigbee2mqtt/external_converters (if folder does not exist create it).
Then reboot Zigbee2MQTT in Settings/Add-ons/Zigbee2MQTT/Info and press Restart (takes 30 seconds)
In Home Assistant, open Settings → Devices & Services → Zigbee2MQTT → Permit join.
Test button clicks (single, double, hold).
You can now create an automation based on the button clicks.

If in the Zigbee2MQTT interface/Devices/deviceName/Exposes there is not 2 attributes (Action, Linkquality) there is an issue.
You may have to change the cluster name to fit your home assistant. It is used 4 times in my file and called "manuSpecificAssaDoorLock".
This name is automatically attributed by home assistant and cannot be changed.
To find your cluster name, simply check the logs in Zigbee2MQTT. I prefer checking them in the add-on directly since there is more information.
Add-on logs accessible in Settings/Add-ons/Zigbee2MQTT/Log
